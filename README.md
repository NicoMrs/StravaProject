## Requesting Data Using the Strava API

This application is designed to make request to the Strava API so that one can access and download its training data.


Before requesting your data, you need:
 - client_id
 - client_secret

You can find client ID and client secret in your [application page](https://www.strava.com/settings/api). 

Then you should update the [user_id.json](https://github.com/NicoMrs/Strava/tree/main/packages/strava/user_info) with these information.

You can start the app to download your personnal data.
